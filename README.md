# Enhancing Smart-Mobility with Machine-Learning
This repository contains a series of projects developed as part of the "ICT for Smart Mobility" course at Politecnico di Torino. 
The projects focus on analyzing and optimizing smart mobility systems through advanced data analysis, time series forecasting, and user behavior modeling.
The work spans multiple labs, each targeting specific aspects of car-sharing systems, including network performance, demand prediction, and user pattern analysis.

Lab 1:
Analysis of Car-Sharing System Data
Description: This project focuses on analyzing the data from car-sharing systems across various cities, including Vancouver, Milan, and Rome. The analysis includes the examination of booking and parking records to identify patterns and trends in user behavior. The project uses MongoDB for data management and Python for statistical analysis, with a specific focus on cumulative distribution functions (CDF), system utilization, and filtering techniques to enhance the accuracy of the findings.  
Lab 2: 
Time Series Analysis and Prediction Using ARIMA Models
Description: This project involves applying ARIMA models to predict car rental demand in smart mobility systems. The analysis focuses on data from Vancouver, Milan, and Rome, collected over January 2018. The project compares different modeling strategies, including sliding and expanding windows, to optimize the prediction accuracy. Key metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) were used to evaluate the model performance. 
Lab 3:
User Behavior Analysis through Origin-Destination Matrices
Description: In this project, we analyze user behavior in car-sharing systems by comparing Origin-Destination (OD) matrices derived from car rental data with those derived from user interviews (IMQ dataset). The analysis focuses on understanding travel patterns and preferences across different user demographics and time periods. Techniques such as Euclidean distance calculations are used to compare and identify similarities between different user categories.
